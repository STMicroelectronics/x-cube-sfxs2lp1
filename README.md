# X-CUBE-SFXS2LP1 Firmware Package

![latest tag](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/STMicroelectronics/x-cube-sfxs2lp1.svg?color=brightgreen)

The X-CUBE-SFXS2LP1 is an expansion software package for STM32Cube. This software provides S2-LP Sigfox library with a complete set of API to develop embedded applications. The pack can be installed and configured by user using CubeMX.User applications can be built using Sigfox long range wireless area network running on the S2-LP high performance ultra-low power RF transceiver. Graphical user interface (GUI) PC application provides an interactive interface to transmit messages to the Sigfox network. The software comes with a sample implementation of the drivers running on the X-NUCLEO-S2868A1 expansion board connected to a NUCLEO-L073RZ, NUCLEO-L152RE or NUCLEO-L476RG development board. It is built on top of STM32Cube software technology that ease portability across different STM32 microcontrollers.

In this FW Package, the modules listed below are not directly accessible as they are subject to some restrictive license terms requiring user's approval via a "click thu" procedure. They have to be downloaded from the [www.st.com](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en.html) website. The respective URL to download each one of these modules are available in a readme.txt file at the root of each folder.
